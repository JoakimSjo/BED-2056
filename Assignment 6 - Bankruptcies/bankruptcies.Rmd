## Cumulative number of Bankruptcies

In this assignment we will use data from Bronnesundregisteret to see if Covid-19 have had any impact on the number of business that have got 
bankrupt this year compared to last year. We scrape the data from the table present on Brregs-website. With the data we count the number of bankruptcies 
each month for each county in Norway.

## Results

```{r plot, message=FALSE}
plot()
```

From the results we can assume that Covid-19 have not had any impact on the number of companies that went bankrupt. The differences between 2019 and 2020 are 
very small and these may be natural variances.
